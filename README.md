## Implementation Tasks
1. Database Creation: Create sales_sample table with required fields
   - Product_Id
   - Region
   - Date
   - Sales_Amount

2. Data Creation: Insert 10 sample records into sales_sample table

3. OLAP Operations:
   - Drill Down: Analyze sales data at a more detailed level
   - Rollup: Summarize sales data at different granularity levels
   - Cube: Analyze sales data from multiple dimensions
   - Slice: Extract subset of data based on specific criteria
   - Dice: View sales for specific combinations of dimensions

## Results
All functionalities have been implemented and documented with corresponding screenshots.
